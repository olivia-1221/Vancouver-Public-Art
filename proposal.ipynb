The piece was fabricated in Vanier Park during the summer of 1986 where visitors were invited to watch the construction process and interact with the artist.  The piece primarily consists of numerous parallel steel pipes intended to provide the sense of driving rain. Attached to many of these angled rain-like elements are shorter smaller pipes producing a simplified tree forms.   Interspersed among the pipe components are various objects associated with forestry; a crosscut saw, a baseball bat, a ladder, a house, all set at the identical angle to the tree branches.\r\n",

       "4 Rainforest was designed in response to a call for public outdoor sculptures to be constructed and exhibited at Expo ‘86 in Vancouver. The piece was fabricated in Vanier Park during the summer of 1986 where visitors were invited to watch the construction process and interact with the artist.  The piece primarily consists of numerous parallel steel pipes intended to provide the sense of driving rain. Attached to many of these angled rain-like elements are shorter smaller pipes producing a simplified tree forms.   Interspersed among the pipe components are various objects associated with forestry; a crosscut saw, a baseball bat, a ladder, a house, all set at the identical angle to the tree branches.\\r\\nThe intention is to merge the visual sense of driving rain with trees and objects associated with forestry. Excessive repetition causes the piece to appear both chaotic and ordered.  Hopefully viewers can focus on any one of, or all of these elements simultaneously.\n",
